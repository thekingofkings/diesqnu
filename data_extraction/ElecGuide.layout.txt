                  Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate
Introduction

       As a result of changes in the law in Pennsylvania, consumers can choose the company that
provides them with a portion of their electric service. This guide has been prepared by the
Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate to help residential consumers make that choice.

      The Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate is a state office whose job is to represent
Pennsylvania consumers in matters involving their utility services.

        It is important to understand that consumers only have a choice as to a portion of their electricity
service. The power lines that run down your street and into your home will still be operated by your
local electric distribution company, and the rates for the delivery portion of your service will still be
regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.

        But Pennsylvania consumers can choose the company
that sells the electric power, or generation, that is delivered over
those distribution lines. Some companies may offer electric
generation service that is cheaper than the power sold by your
local electric distribution company; some companies may offer
types of generation that are cleaner to produce.

         No matter whom you buy your power from, the
reliability and quality of your local electric distribution service will not change. In addition, only
companies that are licensed by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission are allowed to sell electric
generation to consumers in Pennsylvania.

How To Shop for Electricity

                              Each local electric utility has a “price to compare.” The price to compare
                      is the price charged by your local utility for the portion of your service that is open
                      to competition.

                              The price to compare is given in cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). One way
                      to think about a “kilowatt hour” is the amount of electricity needed to keep ten 100
                      watt light bulbs burning for one hour. A typical residential customer may use
                      about 500 kilowatt hours of electricity every month for normal lighting and
                      appliances. If you have electric heat, you are likely to use much more electricity
                      in the winter months. If you have air conditioning, your usage will likely be
                      higher in the summer months. The best place to find your own monthly usage is
                      by looking at recent bills you received from your electric distribution company.

                            Once you know your utility’s price to compare and your own typical
                       monthly usage, you can begin to shop for your electric supplier.
        Included in this guide is a list of names, telephone numbers and web addresses of licensed
electric generation suppliers who have indicated an
                                                              Price to Compare           10¢/kWh
interest in serving residential customers in your area.
By comparing the supplier’s price per kilowatt hour           New Supplier Price      - 9¢/kWh
with your electric distribution company’s price to
compare you can find out whether or not you will save         Savings                    1¢/kWh
money by switching.
                                                              Savings                    1¢/kWh
        For example, as this table shows, if your           Monthly Use                 X 500 kWh
electric distribution company’s price to compare is
10¢ per kWh and the competing electric generation           Savings per Month              $5.00
supplier is charging 9¢, then you can save 1¢ on every
kilowatt hour that you use. If you use 500 kWh in a
month, then you will save $5.00. If you use 1000
kWh in a month, then you will save $10.00


How To Use This Guide

        The purpose of this guide is to help residential consumers get started in shopping for their
electric supplier.

        We have collected information about each of Pennsylvania’s major electric distribution
companies as well as the electric generation suppliers who are presently offering service to residential
customers in each area. We have attached a chart for each company showing the utility company’s
price to compare, and the comparable price being charged by the electric generation suppliers. We
have also calculated the monthly bills for suppliers’ services at three different usage levels -- 500 kWh,
1000 kWh, and 2000 kWh per month. If a supplier includes a monthly charge in addition to the price
per kilowatt hour, then we have spread that charge over the applicable usage. For example, if a supplier
charges $5.00 per month, plus 10¢ per kWh; and if a consumer uses 500 kWh, then the monthly bill in
our chart would be $55.00.

       It is also important to note that we have not
                                                                New Supplier Price per                 10¢/kWh
included other parts of your electric bill in our
                                                                kWh
comparison charts. All customers will also have to pay
other charges to their electric distribution company to         Monthly Usage                      X 500 kWh

additional charges are the same regardless of who you           Monthly Usage Cost                       $50.00

                                            Renewable Electricity Certification Program is a program of
                                            the non-profit Center for Resource Solutions. The Green-e
                                            Energy program was established to provide information and
                                            an objective standard for consumers to compare electricity
                                            products, and to verify that consumers get what they pay for.
                                            For more information, or an updated list of certified providers

       Our chart also states whether companies charge an early cancellation fee. Some companies
charge this fee for cancelling a contract before the end of the specified time period.

        Finally, our charts only include basic residential and residential heating rates under which the
great majority of Pennsylvania residential consumers are served. Some Pennsylvania electric
distribution companies may offer other special rates that vary based on time of day and by peak usage or
that are associated with particular types of service.

Now It’s Your Turn

        This document is only a guide to start you in the shopping process. We have tried to gather
accurate information from all the residential suppliers that we are aware of in each territory, but there
may be additional products available. Also, prices change. You should always contact the supplier
directly to make sure that you understand the price that you will have to pay as well as all other contract
terms, such as the length of the contract and any other fees for switching to or from a particular supplier.
Also, each electric distribution company’s price to compare will change periodically in the future.
